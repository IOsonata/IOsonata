[Eclipse IDE installation guide](https://www.i-syst.com/article/eclipse-ide-firmware-development-iosonata)

Although this library supports multiple IDE/Compilers, the preferred IDE is still Eclipse/GCC.  GCC is the de facto standard for embedded software development. Eclipse is 100% free and the most flexible IDE.  It could be little overwhelming for newbies at first (like any other IDE if you are new to it anyway).

For desktop PC version of the library, native compiler and IDE are used.  XCode for OSX, Visual Studio for Windows, Eclipse for Linux.

--- 
### IDE limiations :

* Eclipse & GCC : Full C++ support, full file io support.
* IAR : Full C++ support, no system support for file io.  File io only available with semihosting. Bug in IAR : It cannot debug or flash Nordic nRF series using CMSIS-DAP. 
* uVision : Requires compiler version 6. Minimal support for file IO.  However uVision can be configured to GCC instead.
* CrossWorks : GCC C++ is stripped down to bare bone, no file io support, no atomic support and many others. In order to use full GCC C++, CrossWorks must be configured to use an external compiler.
* Segger Stusio : Stripped down version of CrossWorks.  Even less functional. Only supports jlink, cannot be used with any other jtag. SES is not recommended for heavy firmware development.

### Required installation of external SDK and libraries :

In order to compile the IOsonata target libraries these external SDK & lib are required. Follow the instructions below to download and install into appropriate folder locations and naming. 
 
 
[nRF5_SDK](https://github.com/IOsonata/nRF5_SDK)  : Nordic nRF5x Bluetooth Low Energy

[nRF5_SDK_Mesh](https://github.com/IOsonata/nRF5_SDK_Mesh) : Nordic nRF5 SDK for Bluetoth Mesh

[nrfx](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrfx) : Nordic nrfx for nRF series MCU

[ICM-20948 Motion_Driver](https://invensense.tdk.com/developers/software-downloads/) : Create a user at https://invensense.tdk.com/developers/software-downloads/. In the "Development Kits" block, download "DK-20948 SmartMotion eMD 1.1.0". Unzip the downloaded file and navigate to EMD-Core/sources. Copy the folder `Invn` to `external/Invn` as indicated in the folder tree bellow.

[BSEC](https://github.com/boschsensortec/Bosch-BSEC2-Library) : Bosch Sensortec Environmental Cluster (BSEC) Software for #BME680 environmental sensor.  BSEC is needed for calculating Air Quality Index.  Go to https://github.com/boschsensortec/Bosch-BSEC2-Library. Clone it to `external/BSEC` as indicated in the folder tree below.  
 
[LWIP](https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/) : A Lightweight TCP/IP stack. This library is required for IoT network connectivity over Ethernet, Wifi, LTE, ... Download it via this link https://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/lwip/. Rename the extracted folder as `lwip` and copy it to `external`.

### IOsonata folder structure

 
The way the IOsonata folder is structured is simple.  The deeper you go inside the more it is specific to the architecture or platform.  The parent folder contains all that is commonly available to the child folder.  Which means, source file from child folder can access any source in the upper parent folder but not the other way around.  This is the way to keep the abstraction separated from implementation and easier to keep track of things.
