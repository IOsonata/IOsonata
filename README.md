# IOsonata üé∂ ‚Äî Make Your I/Os Sing  
**The high-performance, multi-platform C++ HAL for IoT, wearables, and embedded innovation.**

---

## üåü Why IOsonata?
Embedded firmware doesn‚Äôt need to be painful.  
IOsonata is an **open-source, cross-vendor hardware abstraction layer (HAL)** that makes microcontroller firmware:  

- üöÄ **Fast** ‚Üí Optimized drivers proven faster than vendor SDKs.  
- üîÄ **Portable** ‚Üí Same source code runs on Nordic, ST, NXP, Renesas, and more.  
- üéØ **Simple** ‚Üí Swap a `board.h` pin map, recompile, and your app runs on a new board.  
- üíª **Multi-Platform** ‚Üí Build and test on macOS, Linux, and Windows before flashing hardware.  

From prototyping to production, IOsonata helps you **spend less time fighting BSPs** and more time building products.

---

## üöÄ Features
- **Cross-Architecture Support**  
  ARM Cortex-M, Nordic nRF, NXP LPC, ST STM32, and beyond.  

- **Driver Coverage**  
  UART, I¬≤C, SPI, PDM, ADC/DAC, Timers, USB, BLE, Sensors, and more.  

- **Performance-Proven**  
  Real-world benchmarks include **streaming uncompressed 16kHz audio over BLE**.  

- **Broad IDE Support**  
  Works with Eclipse/GCC, IAR, Keil uVision, CrossWorks, and native compilers on desktop.  

- **IoT Ready**  
  Integrates with external SDKs like Nordic nRF5, Bosch BSEC, Invensense Motion, and LWIP for connectivity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
To compile IOsonata target libraries, install the following external SDKs/libs into `/external`:  

- [nRF5_SDK](https://github.com/IOsonata/nRF5_SDK) ‚Äî Nordic BLE SDK  
- [nRF5_SDK_Mesh](https://github.com/IOsonata/nRF5_SDK_Mesh) ‚Äî Nordic Mesh SDK  
- [nrfx](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrfx) ‚Äî Nordic MCU HAL  
- [Invensense ICM-20948 Motion Driver](https://invensense.tdk.com/developers/software-downloads/)  
- [Bosch BSEC](https://github.com/boschsensortec/Bosch-BSEC2-Library) ‚Äî Environmental AI/air quality  
- [LWIP](https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/) ‚Äî Lightweight TCP/IP stack

## üîå Hardware Dev Kits
- **[IDK-BLYST-NANO](https://www.tindie.com/products/hnhoan/bluetooth5mesh-nrf52832-arm-m4f-nano-devkit/)**  
  nRF52832 Bluetooth 5.2/Mesh dev board with built-in CMSIS-DAP debugger  

- **[BLUEIO-TAG-EVIM](https://www.crowdsupply.com/i-syst/blyst-nano)**  
  Sensor board compatible with Nordic Thingy App  

---

## üìÇ Folder Structure
IOsonata follows a **layered folder structure**:  

- **Generic Layer**: Common APIs and sources (`/include`, `/src`)  
- **Architecture Layer**: ARM Cortex, Linux, OSX, Windows  
- **Vendor Layer**: Nordic, NXP, ST, etc.  
- **Target Layer**: MCU-specific libraries + example projects  

This ensures **clean separation of abstraction and implementation** while keeping portability.  

---

## üß™ Example: Blink
Each MCU target includes example projects (`Blink`, UART, SPI, etc.) in multiple IDE formats:  
- Eclipse/GCC  
- IAR  
- Keil uVision  
- CrossWorks  

Compile, flash, and run in minutes.

üí° **Tagline:** *IOsonata ‚Äî Fast, portable, and production-ready. Your firmware foundation for the next generation of IoT.*  


Although this library supports multiple IDE/Compilers, the preferred IDE is still Eclipse/GCC.  GCC is the de facto standard for embedded software development. Eclipse is 100% free and the most flexible IDE.  It could be little overwhelming for newbies at first (like any other IDE if you are new to it anyway).

For desktop PC version of the library, native compiler and IDE are used.  XCode for OSX, Visual Studio for Windows, Eclipse for Linux.

--- 
### IDE limiations :

* Eclipse & GCC : Full C++ support, full file io support.
* IAR : Full C++ support, no system support for file io.  File io only available with semihosting. Bug in IAR : It cannot debug or flash Nordic nRF series using CMSIS-DAP. 
* uVision : Requires compiler version 6. Minimal support for file IO.  However uVision can be configured to GCC instead.
* CrossWorks : GCC C++ is stripped down to bare bone, no file io support, no atomic support and many others. In order to use full GCC C++, CrossWorks must be configured to use an external compiler.
* Segger Stusio : Stripped down version of CrossWorks.  Even less functional. Only supports jlink, cannot be used with any other jtag. SES is not recommended for heavy firmware development.

### IOsonata folder structure

 
The way the IOsonata folder is structured is simple.  The deeper you go inside the more it is specific to the architecture or platform.  The parent folder contains all that is commonly available to the child folder.  Which means, source file from child folder can access any source in the upper parent folder but not the other way around.  This is the way to keep the abstraction separated from implementation and easier to keep track of things.
