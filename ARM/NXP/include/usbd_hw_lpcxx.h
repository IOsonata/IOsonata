	// This event is time-critical; it is run once per millisecond (full-speed mode) and

	// Event for remote wake-up configuration, when enabled. This event fires when the USB
	// host request the device to configure itself for remote wake-up capability. The USB
	// host sends this request to device which report remote wake-up capable in their
	// device descriptors, before going to low-power state. The application layer should
	// implement this callback if they have any special on board circuit to trigger remote
	// wake up event. Also application can use this callback to differentiate the following
	// SUSPEND event is caused by cable plug-out or host SUSPEND request. The device can
	// wake-up host only after receiving this callback and remote wake-up feature is
	// enabled by host. To signal remote wake-up the device has to generate resume signaling
	// on bus by calling usapi.hw->WakeUp() routine.
	//
	// Parameters:
	// 		[in]	hUsb	Handle to the USB device stack.
	// 		[in]	param1	When 0 - Clear the wake-up configuration,
